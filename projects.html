    <a href="http://wikifractal.herokuapp.com/">Wiki Fractal</a>: Enter a keyword to find relevant topics, and then find topics that are relevant to those. Created during HackTJ 2016 with Alex Wang, Alex Fried, and Varun Iyengar.  <br><br>
    <a href="http://lassyla.me/WebDev/index.html">Web App Portfolio</a>: All of the assignments from my Web App Dev Class in my Junior Year of High School (2015-16). I made it look like a cool inventory, which you can control with arrow keys.  <br> <br>
